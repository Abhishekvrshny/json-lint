## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. Push your code to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages
3. Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/json-lint`

### Manual Deployment

Since this is a static site, you can deploy it anywhere:

1. Upload all files to your web server
2. Ensure `index.html` is accessible
3. No server-side configuration required

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/json-lint.git
   cd json-lint
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve with a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## 🎨 Customization

### Themes

The application supports custom themes through CSS variables. You can modify the color scheme by updating the CSS variables in `css/styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #3b82f6;
    --success-color: #10b981;
    --error-color: #ef4444;
    /* ... other variables */
}
```

### Adding Features

The modular architecture makes it easy to add new features:

1. Add new methods to the appropriate class (`JSONLinter`, `UIManager`, or `JSONLintApp`)
2. Update the UI in `index.html` if needed
3. Add corresponding styles in `css/styles.css`
